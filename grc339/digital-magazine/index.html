                            <p>Bryan Woo wasn’t expected to shine, but four years after a modest college career and a sixth-round draft pick, he’s become the Mariners’ most valuable pitcher. Rising fast through the minors, refining his arsenal, and showing remarkable consistency, Woo is stepping up amid a shaky rotation. With a strong 2025 start and the spotlight on his unique skill set, can he help Seattle hold their division lead?</p>
